     Asymptomatic: Someone who has an infection without ever showing symptoms., 
Presymptomatic: Someone who has been infected with a virus but isn't yet showing symptoms., 
Coronavirus: A group of viruses common in humans and animals. Some coronaviruses produce the common cold; SARS and MERS are also both coronaviruses. COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus. 
Community spread: When a contagious illness spreads throughout a community of people who haven't traveled to a place where the virus began, or who haven't knowingly been in contact with anyone who has had the virus. 
Incubation period: The time it takes between catching a virus and feeling sick from it. 
Ventilator: A machine that pushes air into a person's lungs to help them breathe. 
Novel strain: A new type of virus. 
Pathogen: Any microorganism (including bacteria and viruses) that causes infection. 
Patient zero: The first person to contract a virus in a new area. 
PPE: An acronym for personal protective equipment. It describes the special masks, clothing and gloves worn by care providers to shield them from contagious illnesses. 
Social distancing: The act of increasing physical space between people to decrease the spread of an illness. (In the case of COVID-19, social distancing of at least six feet is recommended.) 
Self-isolation: Separating oneself from others because you are sick. 
Self-quarantine: Separating oneself from others because you have been exposed to a sick person. 
Shelter-in-place: Used as a safety measure after an emergency, this is an order from the government for citizens to stay at home, leaving only to get necessities like food and medicine. 
Super spreader: A person who transmits a virus to many more people than average. 
Underlying conditions: Chronic health conditions not caused by a current virus. (For example, diabetes, heart and kidney diseases, and obesity are all underlying conditions.) 
Flatten the curve: Slowing the rate of infection among people so hospitals can treat fewer people over time. 
Antibody: Specific proteins in the blood used by the immune system to attack viruses and diseases in order to heal the body. 
Outbreak: When many people in a localized area suddenly become ill. 
Epidemic: Widespread illness in one region or community.
Pandemic: Wides pread illness around the world.
Surgical mask: A disposable face mask worn by health professionals to prevent saliva or mucus from coming out or going in. 
N95 respirator: A special protective mask that filters out tiny particles and pathogens to protect the wearer from contracting a disease.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
